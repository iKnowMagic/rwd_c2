                "Be careful of your thoughts, for your thoughts become your words."
              </p>
              <p>
                Every word that comes out of your mouth comes from a thought - whether consciously or unconsciously. We've all had the experience of blurting something out and also of thinking we said something that we didn't. If we think happy thoughts, we'll talk happy. If we think ugly thoughts, our words will be ugly.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Be careful of your words, for your words become your actions."
              </p>
              <p>
                Our tone of voice and our body language not only follow with the words we are saying - whether sweet or harsh - they follow the thought we have behind our words.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Be careful of your actions, for your actions become your habits."
              </p>
              <p>
                ALL of the habits we have were created by the actions we choose to take over and over again. Habits can be broken when we begin to take different actions which will form positive habits.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Be careful of your habits, for your habits become your character."
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the way other people see us. They can't feel our feelings - or think our thoughts, they only hear our words - see our actions and habits that define who we are and what we stand for.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Be careful of your character, for your character becomes your destiny."
              </p>
              <p>
                Our destiny - our reality - our world. Each of us has a unique perception of the world we live in. This is because we have created it - by our past thoughts.
